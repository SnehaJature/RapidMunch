		     An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or phone, or through a food ordering company. 
		    The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. 
		    The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.
            Customers can, depending on the delivery company, choose to pay online or in person, with cash or card. 
            A flat rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought. 
            Tips are often customary for food delivery service.

	  	<p style="color: black;font-size: 18px;"> cuisine is an extensive balance of many different tastes. It includes a range of dishes from mild to very spicy tastes.
	  	 Bajri, wheat, rice, jowar, vegetables, lentils, and fruit form important components of the Maharashtrian diet.
	  	 Popular dishes include puran poli, ukdiche modak, batata wada, sabudana khichdi, masala bhat, pav bhaji, and wada pav.
	  	  Poha or flattened rice is also usually eaten at breakfast.
	  	  Kanda poha and aloo poha are some of the dishes cooked for breakfast and snacking in evenings.
	  	  Popular spicy meat dishes include those that originated in the Kolhapur region.
	  	  These are the Kolhapuri Sukka mutton, pandhra rassa, and tabmda rassa. Shrikhand, a sweet dish made from strained yogurt, is a main dessert of Maharashtrian cuisine.
	  	   The cuisine of Maharashtra can be divided into two major sections—the coastal and the interior.
	  	  The Konkan, on the coast of the Arabian Sea, has its own type of cuisine, a homogeneous combination of Malvani, Goud Saraswat Brahmin, and Goan cuisine.
	  	   In the interior of Maharashtra, the Paschim Maharashtra, Khandesh, Vidarbha and Marathwada areas have their own distinct cuisines.
	      The cuisine of Vidarbha uses groundnuts, poppy seeds, jaggery, wheat, jowar, and bajra extensively.
	       A typical meal consists of rice, roti, poli, or bhakar, along with varan and aamtee—lentils and spiced vegetables. 
	       Cooking is common with different types of oil. Savji food from Vidarbha is well known all over Maharashtra.
	  	   Savji dishes are very spicy and oily. Savji mutton curries are very famous.
